# System Patterns: Echo Hierarchical Coding System

This document will record recurring architectural and design patterns identified and utilized within the Echo Hierarchical Coding System. As the system evolves, patterns related to agent interaction, context management, task decomposition, error handling, and other systemic behaviors will be documented here.

## Guiding Principles for Patterns

-   **Clarity:** Patterns should be clearly named and described.
-   **Problem/Solution:** Each pattern should articulate the problem it solves and the solution it proposes.
-   **Context:** The context in which the pattern is applicable should be defined.
-   **Examples:** Concrete examples from the system's implementation should be provided where possible.

## Initial Placeholder Patterns (To be detailed later)

1.  **Planner-Executor Delegation Pattern:**
    *   **Problem:** How to separate high-level planning and reasoning from detailed, granular execution.
    *   **Solution:** Employ a Planner agent (Echo) for creating detailed step-by-step plans and one or more Executor agents for implementing those individual steps.
    *   **Context:** Core architectural pattern for task decomposition and AI agent responsibility assignment.

2.  **Memory-Augmented Context Pattern (Externalized Memory):**
    *   **Problem:** LLMs have limited context windows and volatile memory.
    *   **Solution:** Utilize an external, structured Memory Bank (filesystem-based markdown files) that agents can read from to gain necessary context for tasks.
    *   **Context:** Fundamental pattern for providing persistent and extensive knowledge to LLMs.

3.  **Task-Driven Workflow Pattern:**
    *   **Problem:** How to manage and track software development work in a structured manner.
    *   **Solution:** Define all development work as discrete tasks in standardized markdown files (`tasks/*.md`), which drive the entire planning and execution process.
    *   **Context:** Project management and workflow organization.

4.  **Incremental Context Update Pattern (`activeContext.md` & `progress.md`):**
    *   **Problem:** How to maintain a "short-term memory" or current operational focus for Echo and track progress.
    *   **Solution:** Use `activeContext.md` to store immediate session details, focus points, and critical observations. Use `progress.md` to log significant achievements and task completions.
    *   **Context:** Session management and progress tracking for the AI and human developers.
