# Detailed Progress Logs Index

This directory is intended for more detailed or periodic progress reports, sprint summaries, or specific deep dives into task progress that might be too verbose for the main `memory-bank/progress.md` file.

## Purpose

The `progress/` subdirectory allows for:
-   Storing historical progress snapshots (e.g., end-of-sprint reports).
-   Documenting detailed investigations or progress on particularly complex tasks.
-   Keeping the main `memory-bank/progress.md` concise with high-level milestones, while providing a place for more granular tracking if needed.

## Examples of Content

-   **Sprint Reports:**
    -   `sprint_YYYY-MM-DD_summary.md`: Summary of achievements, challenges, and learnings from a specific sprint.
-   **Detailed Task Logs:**
    -   `task_CREW-001_detailed_log.md`: A day-by-day or step-by-step log for a complex task like the initial CrewAI POC.
-   **Release Notes (Drafts or Internal):**
    -   `release_v0.1_notes.md`: Internal notes and list of features/fixes for an upcoming release.

## How to Use

-   The main `memory-bank/progress.md` should still be the primary source for high-level milestones and overall project status.
-   Documents in this directory can be linked from the main `progress.md` or from specific task files in `tasks/` if detailed logging is beneficial for that task.
-   Use this directory judiciously to avoid excessive or redundant information. The goal is clarity and useful historical context, not just volume.

*(This index should be updated as new types of detailed progress documents are added or a more formal structure emerges.)*
