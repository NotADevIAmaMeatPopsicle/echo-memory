# System-Level Documentation Index

This directory contains documentation related to broader system-level concerns, overall architecture, and major functional modules of the Echo Hierarchical Coding System.

## Purpose

The `system/` directory is intended to house documents that provide a high-level understanding of how different parts of the project fit together, its core architectural principles, and descriptions of significant, non-component-specific functionalities.

## Examples of Content

-   **Overall System Architecture:**
    -   `architecture_overview.md`: Describes the main architectural style (e.g., microservices, modular monolith), key layers, and high-level data flow. May include diagrams.
    -   `deployment_strategy.md`: Outlines how the system is deployed to different environments.
-   **Data Models (High-Level):**
    -   `data_model_overview.md`: Describes the main entities, their relationships, and the overall data management strategy. Detailed schemas would reside in `memory-bank/reference/database-schema/`.
-   **Core Services / Modules:**
    -   `[module_name]/overview.md`: For each major non-UI module or backend service, an overview of its responsibilities, APIs (high-level, details in `reference/`), and interactions.
    -   `authentication_authorization.md`: Describes the system's approach to security.
-   **Workflow Descriptions:**
    -   `main_user_workflow.md`: Describes a key end-to-end user workflow through the system.

## How to Use

-   **Starting Point for Architecture:** Developers looking to understand the system's architecture should start here.
-   **Context for New Features:** When planning new features that impact multiple parts of the system, these documents provide essential context.
-   **Linking:** These documents may link to more detailed specifications in `memory-bank/reference/` or to specific component documentation in `memory-bank/components/`.
