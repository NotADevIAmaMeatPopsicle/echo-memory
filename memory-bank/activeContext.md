# Active Context: Echo Hierarchical Coding System

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-16 04:12:46 UTC <!-- This should be dynamically updated -->

## Current Overall Focus

-   **Phase:** Project Initialization & Memory Bank Bootstrap.
-   **Objective:** Finalize the foundational directory structure and core documentation for the Echo Hierarchical Coding System. This includes ensuring all main Memory Bank files, READMEs, task system files, prompt files, and essential subdirectories within `memory-bank/` (like `reference/`, `system/`, `components/`, `cross-cutting/`, `progress/`) are created and accurately reflect the system's design. Prepare for the CrewAI POC development.

## Current Task in Progress

-   **Task ID/Name:** System Initialization / Memory Bank Bootstrap
-   **Description:** Setting up the project's directory structure and initial documentation as outlined in the "Memory Bank Bootstrap Protocol."
-   **Key Steps Completed / Current Status:**
    -   Initial project structure and most core files created.
    -   `prompts/echo_system_prompt.md` updated with new sections 7 and 8.
    -   `README.md` updated by user.
    -   `README_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` updated for consistency.
    -   `memory-bank/index.md` updated with new subdirectories.
    -   New Memory Bank subdirectories (`reference/`, `system/`, `components/`, `cross-cutting/`, `progress/`) created with placeholder `index.md` files.
    -   `memory-bank/techContext.md` updated.
-   **Focus:** Ensuring all documentation is consistent and the project is ready for CrewAI POC development as per `tasks/CREW-001-CrewAI_Orchestration_POC.md`.

## Immediate Next Steps

1.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to log all recent file creations and updates.
2.  Review all created/updated files for consistency and accuracy.
3.  Proceed with the CrewAI POC development as outlined in `tasks/CREW-001-CrewAI_Orchestration_POC.md`.

## Key Observations / Blockers / Questions

-   *No blockers currently identified.*
-   *Ensure all file paths and links within markdown documents are correct relative to their location.*

## Important Notes for Echo (AI Planner)

-   You are currently in the bootstrap phase. Your primary goal is to ensure all foundational documents and structures are correctly established.
-   Refer to `productContext.md` and `techContext.md` for details about the system being built.
-   The next major phase will be the implementation of the CrewAI POC, as will be detailed in `tasks/CREW-001-CrewAI_Orchestration_POC.md`.
