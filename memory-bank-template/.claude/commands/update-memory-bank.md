# Command: /update-memory-bank
# Usage: /update-memory-bank <task_id_or_feature_summary> "<detailed_summary_of_changes_made>" [@relevant_file_path_1.js] [@relevant_test_file.js] [...]
# Example: /update-memory-bank TASK-2.5-FixErrorHandlerLogging "Resolved logger context issues in error-handler.test.js and updated handleServiceError logging" @src/src/utils/error-handler.js @src/tests/unit/utils/error-handler.test.js

Based on the work completed for **"${1}"** with the summary **"${2}"**, and considering the affected code files: ${@slice 3} (if provided, otherwise infer from summary).

Your task is to update the project's Memory Bank comprehensively.

**Key Memory Bank Files to ALWAYS Check & Potentially Update:**
*   `@memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Update "Recently Completed", "Current Status", "Next Immediate Action". Reflect the completion of "${1}" and summarize "${2}".
*   `@memory-bank/progress.md`: Update overall project status, task completion statuses (link to new/updated completion report).
*   `@memory-bank/testingContext.md`: If test strategies, tools, or common issues changed, or if new significant test patterns were established or resolved.
*   `@memory-bank/CLAUDE.md`: If the "Current Project Status & Focus" or "Known Issues" sections need updating based on "${1}" and "${2}".

**Actions to Perform:**

1.  **Analyze Changes:** Review the summary "${2}" and the provided files ${@slice 3}. If necessary, read the content of these code files to fully understand the scope of changes.

2.  **Generate Task Completion Report (if applicable):**
    *   If "${1}" indicates a specific task ID (e.g., "TASK-X.Y"), generate a new task completion report named `task-X.Y-completion-report.md` in `@memory-bank/task-completion-reports/`.
    *   This report should be detailed, based on "${2}" and the affected files, following the style of existing reports.
    *   If no specific task ID, skip this step.

3.  **Identify ALL Relevant Memory Bank Files to Update:**
    *   Beyond the "ALWAYS Check" list, consider component-specific documentation in `@memory-bank/components/`, relevant issue files in `@memory-bank/issues/` (if this work resolves an issue), and potentially `systemPatterns.md` or `techContext.md` if core patterns/tech changed.
    *   Use `@memory-bank/index.md` as a guide to the MB structure.

4.  **Propose Updates for Each Identified Memory Bank File:**
    *   For each MB file you determine needs an update:
        *   Read its current content using `@filePath`.
        *   Propose specific, concise changes (e.g., "In `@memory-bank/activeContext.md`, under 'Recently Completed', add: ..."). Use diff format if helpful.
        *   Ensure `Last Updated` dates and version numbers are incremented where appropriate.
        *   Maintain existing markdown formatting.

5.  **Execute Git Actions for Memory Bank Updates:**
    *   Stage all changes: Execute `git add .` to stage all Memory Bank file modifications
    *   Commit with comprehensive message: Execute `git commit` with a detailed commit message including:
        *   Conventional commit format: "docs(memory-bank): Update MB for completion of ${1}"
        *   Summary of changes made: Brief description of "${2}"
        *   Files affected: List of Memory Bank files updated
        *   Elite task status updates: Any task registry or status changes
        *   Generated with Claude Code signature
    *   Push changes: Execute `git push` to sync with remote repository
    *   
    **Commit Message Template:**
