# Echo Hierarchical Coding System

Welcome to the Echo Hierarchical Coding System! This repository contains an AI-driven software development framework designed to enhance code quality, consistency, and development efficiency through structured documentation and intelligent task delegation.

**The core idea is to empower an AI persona named "Echo" to act as an expert Software Architect and Lead Developer. Due to a simulated periodic memory reset, Echo relies entirely on a comprehensive "Memory Bank" and detailed "Task Files" to function effectively.**

## Key Features & Philosophy

*   **Persistent Context via Memory Bank:** A structured `memory-bank/` directory holds all project-specific knowledge (product context, technical architecture, system patterns, testing strategies, detailed reference materials, etc.).
*   **Detailed Task Management:** A `tasks/` directory contains granular markdown files for every development task, created from a standardized `tasks/TEMPLATE.md`. These files guide Echo's planning and execution.
*   **Hierarchical AI Model:**
    *   **Echo (Planner):** A high-capability AI that consults the Memory Bank and Task Files to produce detailed, step-by-step implementation plans.
    *   **Executor AI(s):** More specialized or cost-effective AIs that execute the granular instructions from Echo's plans.
*   **Documentation-First Approach:** The system's reliance on comprehensive documentation enforces and maintains high-quality project knowledge.
*   **Focus on Test-Driven Development (TDD):** TDD principles are integrated into the task and execution flow.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** The system (prompts, templates, Memory Bank structure) is designed to be iteratively refined.

## Project Structure Overview

*   **`README_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`**: **Start here for a deep dive!** This file contains a comprehensive overview of the system's vision, architecture, components, workflow, and how to contribute or use the system.
*   **`memory-bank/`**: The heart of the system â€“ stores all persistent knowledge.
    *   `index.md`: Main index for Memory Bank files.
    *   `activeContext.md`: Tracks Echo's current operational focus.
    *   `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `testingContext.md`, `progress.md`: Core context files.
    *   `reference/`: Contains detailed, granular reference materials (e.g., full database schemas, detailed API specs) to be consulted on demand.
    *   `components/`, `system/`, `cross-cutting/`: Further categorized documentation.
*   **`tasks/`**: Holds detailed markdown files for specific development tasks.
    *   `TEMPLATE.md`: The standard, structured template that MUST be used for all new task files.
    *   `CREW-001-CrewAI_Orchestration_POC.md`: Example initial task for setting up a CrewAI proof-of-concept.
*   **`prompts/`**: Stores system prompts for AI agents.
    *   `echo_system_prompt.md`: The core system prompt defining the "Echo" AI persona and its operational directives.
    *   `executor_prompt.md`: A sample prompt for an Executor AI.
*   **`echo_crew_ai_poc/` (or `src/`)**: Intended location for the source code of implementations (e.g., the CrewAI proof-of-concept).
*   **`output/`**: Default directory for code generated by Executor agents (typically not version-controlled).
*   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files for Git.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists Python dependencies for automated parts of the system.

## Getting Started

1.  **Thoroughly read the [`README_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`](README_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md)** to understand the full system architecture and principles.
2.  Familiarize yourself with the "Echo" persona by reviewing [`prompts/echo_system_prompt.md`](prompts/echo_system_prompt.md).
3.  Understand the structure and importance of the [`memory-bank/`](memory-bank/) and the format of task files by looking at [`tasks/TEMPLATE.md`](tasks/TEMPLATE.md) and example tasks.
4.  If you plan to contribute to or run the automated parts of the system (like the CrewAI POC detailed in `tasks/CREW-001-CrewAI_Orchestration_POC.md`):
    *   Ensure you have the necessary LLM API keys.
    *   Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
    *   Configure your API keys in a `.env` file at the project root.

## How to Use This System (Conceptual)

1.  **Define a Task:** Create a new task file in the `tasks/` directory using `tasks/TEMPLATE.md`. Fill it out with all necessary details.
2.  **Update Active Context:** Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` to point to the new task file and describe the current focus.
3.  **Engage Echo (Planner):** Interact with an LLM configured with `prompts/echo_system_prompt.md`. Provide it with the task file and guide it to consult the Memory Bank.
4.  **Receive Plan:** Echo will generate a detailed implementation plan.
5.  **Execute Plan:** Use the plan to guide an Executor AI (or manual development), providing one micro-task at a time.
6.  **Test & Iterate:** Follow testing requirements.
7.  **Update Documentation:** Update `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and any relevant Memory Bank or task files.
